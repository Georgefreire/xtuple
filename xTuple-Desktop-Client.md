The Desktop Client is a binary executable used to connect to your xTuple database. It is one of two interfaces that xTuple offers (the other is our web client). 

- Go to our Sourceforge project site to obtain the [xTuple Desktop Client Installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/postbooks/files/latest/download?source=dlp) for your platform. To be sure the PostBooks Desktop Client version matches the PostBooks database version you are installing, look at the "About" information in the Mobile client.

- Run the client installer. On the screen where you select an xTuple database, select "I do not need a Free Trial database."
-  Complete the installation and launch the Desktop Client. On the desktop client login screen, enter the credentials that were displayed at the end of the installation. For example, if you are following the xTuple Server quickstart instructions, the login info is: 
  * User: admin
  * Password: [this will be different for each installation]
  * Server : `192.168.33.10`
  * Port: `5432`
  * Database: `demo_pilot`
