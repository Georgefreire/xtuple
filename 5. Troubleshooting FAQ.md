## Possible Installation Issues
***
**Problem:** My install failed when restoring from a backup file<br/>
**Solution:** If you are restoring from a backup created by the xtuple-server, you are only allowed to restore that backup into clusters owned by the same `--xt-name` that created that backup. Make sure you are naming your new installation after the one that the backup file was backed up from.
***
**Problem:** It's saying I don't have permissions to do something<br/>
**Solution:** A common problem is that postgres cannot start due to a permissions issue somewhere, possibly in `/var/run/postgresql` or elsewhere. If this occurs, please [File an issue](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/issues?state=open).
***
**Problem:** What if your database version is less than 4.4.0?<br/>
**Solution:** Use the [pre-xtuple-server update methodology](https://github.com/xtuple/updater/wiki) to get your database up to the latest version (i.e, use the Updater to apply packages). Then make a backup and install via xtuple server.
***
**Problem:** The provided database file is not able to be automatically built<br/>
**Solution:** Upgrade the database to the current release version first before attempting install.
***
**Problem:** A config file looks wrong.<br/>
**Solution:** [File a bug report](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/issues?state=open). Changing it by hand will probably break some automatically-installed thing you didn't know existed.
***
**Problem:** A cluster already exists.<br/>
**Solution:**  Either run the `uninstall-<type>` command first to uninstall the existing instance, or change the `--xt-name` argument. `--xt-name` and `--xt-version` together identify each installation.

## Can't access the web client

## 502 Bad Gateway
If you try to access the web client and you see `502 Bad Gateway` it probably means that nginx is not running. You can restart nginx with one of the following commands:
first, try
```sudo service nginx reload```
and then try accessing the web client again. If that doesnâ€™t work, try both of these
```sudo service nginx stop```
and then ```sudo nginx```
That will restart nginx. If there are other configuration problems, you will still see an error message.

A second issue that can cause a 502 error is if more than one nginx site is enabled for the same domain. Go to ```/etc/ngnix/sites-enabled/``` and look at the list of sites. You may have accidentally set up more than one site with your domain. Open the nginx configuration file for each domain (the config files are named like `xtname-470-pilot`) and look at the row labeled `server_name`. If you have two or more sites with the same domain, you will have to change or delete one of the config files.

## 504 Gateway Time-out
A 504 Gateway Time-out error may occur if nginx is running but the web client it is trying to load is not at the port specified in the config.js file for node. We have found that occassionally the port numbering in the configs can get out of sync. To check this, go to the directory for your node configuration file which will be in the `/etc/xtuple/` path. For example `/etc/xtuple/xtname-470-pilot/config.js`
In that config file there is a line that specifies the port for the web client. For example:
```# proxy SSL requests to the upstream node server
server {
  listen 41212 default_server ssl;```
The server assigns port numbers to xTuple instances starting with 41212. Each instance will be assigned a port one number higher, so 41213, 41214, etc. If you receive the 504 Gateway Time-out error, you might be able to fix it by checking the port number in the config.js file to make sure it is the same as the port assignment you recorded when you first installed the instance. If you need to change the port number in the config.js file, you can make the change, save the file, and then restart the xtuple service (`sudo service xtuple stop; sudo service xtuple start`).
