These are the instructions for installing an instance of the xTuple ERP application on an xTuple Server. Once you have installed an instance of xTuple ERP you will be able to connect to it with both the Web client and the [xTuple Desktop Client](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki/xTuple-Desktop-Client). 

### a. System Requirements
  - Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04 Operating System
  - >= 4GB RAM
  - Decent internet access (you'll be downloading a lot of stuff)

### b. System Dependencies

  - `bootstrap.sh` installs all required system dependencies. Here are a few of my favorites:
    - `nginx      >  v1.6.0`  (`1.4.6` on Ubuntu 12.04)
    - `nodejs     >= v0.10.32` (manages multiple versions, including the `0.10` and `0.11` series)
    - `npm        >  v1.4.0`
    - `postgres   >= v9.3`
    - `cups       >  v1.5`
    - `sshd       >  v1.5`

### c. Global Binaries
  - `xtupled`
    - Daemon that manages all xTuple Services [forever](https://www.npmjs.org/package/forever)
  - `xtuple-server`
    - the user-facing CLI tool

### d. Running the installer
The `xtuple-server` program is installed by `bootstrap.sh`. It requires `sudo` privileges.

#### Examples

##### a. Development installation

  - Local install for development
```sh
    $ sudo xtuple-server install-dev
      --xt-demo
      --local-workspace ~/dev/xtuple
```

  - `--local-workspace` points to the location in which you've cloned https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple
  - If you are already in the workspace directory (`~/dev/xtuple` in this example) then you do not need to specify a value for `--local-workspace`.
  - The `--xt-version` is automatically set based on the version property in the `package.json` of the workspace that you specify.

##### b. Installation for pilot or live

  - Basic pilot installation example:
    ```
    sudo xtuple-server install-pilot --xt-version 4.7.0 
    --xt-name alpha --pg-capacity 64 --xt-quickstart
    ```
    - `--pg-capacity 64` declares that this server has 64 available installation slots
    - `--xt-quickstart` instructs the installer to install the xTuple Quickstart database
  
  - Production appliance installation example:
      ```
      sudo xtuple-server install-live --xt-version 4.7.0 
        --xt-name alpha 
        --pg-capacity 1
        --nginx-incrt alpha_ssl_bundle.crt
        --nginx-inkey alpha_ssl.key
        --xt-maindb alpha_full.backup
        --xt-edition enterprise
      ```
    - `--pg-capacity 1` tunes xTuple to make maximum use of all available machine resources

    - `--nginx-domain [subdomain].[yourdomain].com` assigns a particular domain to the installation. A subdomain.domain.com address can be assigned to only one installation at a time. If you attempt to install two or more instances at the same domain, nginx will fail and all will become inaccessible. To install multiple instances it is a good practice to have more than one subdomain available, e.g. mobile.domain.com, pilot1.domain.com, pilot460.domain.com, etc.

    - `--xt-edition enterprise` specifies the Enterprise edition of xTuple. Commercial editions of xTuple, including Enterprise, Manufacturing, and Distribution editions, can only be installed if you have a github account with access to the private repo for commercial xTuple software.
