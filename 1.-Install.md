These are the instructions for installing an instance of the xTuple ERP application on an xTuple Server. Once you have installed an instance of xTuple ERP you will be able to connect to it with both the Web client and the [xTuple Desktop Client](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki/xTuple-Desktop-Client). 

### a. System Requirements
  - Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04 Operating System
  - >= 4GB RAM
  - Decent internet access (you'll be downloading a lot of stuff)

### b. System Dependencies

  - `bootstrap.sh` installs all required system dependencies. Here are a few of my favorites:
    - `nginx      >  v1.6.0`  (`1.4.6` on Ubuntu 12.04)
    - `nodejs     >= v0.10.32` (manages multiple versions, including the `0.10` and `0.11` series)
    - `npm        >  v1.4.0`
    - `postgres   >= v9.3`
    - `cups       >  v1.5`
    - `sshd       >  v1.5`

### c. Global Binaries
  - `xtupled`
    - Daemon that manages all xTuple Services [forever](https://www.npmjs.org/package/forever)
  - `xtuple-server`
    - the user-facing CLI tool

### d. Running the installer
The `xtuple-server` program is installed by `bootstrap.sh`. It requires `sudo` privileges.

#### 1. Examples

##### a. Development installation

  - Local install for development
```sh
    $ sudo xtuple-server install-dev
      --xt-demo
      --local-workspace ~/dev/xtuple
```

  - `--local-workspace` points to the location in which you've cloned https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple
  - If you are already in the workspace directory (`~/dev/xtuple` in this example) then you do not need to specify a value for `--local-workspace`.
  - The `--xt-version` is automatically set based on the version property in the `package.json` of the workspace that you specify.

##### b. Installation for pilot or live

  - Basic quickstart cloud deployment example:
    - `xtuple-server install-live --xt-version 4.5.0 --xt-name cloudinator --pg-capacity 64 --xt-quickstart`
    - `--pg-capacity 64` declares that this server has 64 available installation slots
    - `--xt-quickstart` instructs the installer to install the xTuple Quickstart database
  
  - Production appliance deployment example:
      ```
      xtuple-server install-live --xt-version 4.5.0 --xt-name tesla --pg-capacity 1
        --nginx-incrt tesla_ssl_bundle.crt
        --nginx-inkey tesla_ssl.key
        --xt-maindb tesla_full.backup
        --xt-edition enterprise
      ```
    - `--pg-capacity 1` tunes xTuple to make maximum use of all available machine resources

    - `--nginx-domain [subdomain].[yourdomain].com` assigns a particular domain to the installation

    NOTE: A subdomain.domain.com address can be assigned to only one installation at a time. If you attempt to install two or more instances at the same domain, nginx will fail and all will become inaccessible. To install multiple instances it is a good practice to have more than one subdomain available, e.g. mobile.domain.com, pilot1.domain.com, pilot460.domain.com, etc.

#### 2. Possible Installation Issues
***
**Problem:** My install failed when restoring from a backup file<br/>
**Solution:** If you are restoring from a backup created by the xtuple-server, you are only allowed to restore that backup into clusters owned by the same `--xt-name` that created that backup. Make sure you are naming your new installation after the one that the backup file was backed up from.
***
**Problem:** It's saying I don't have permissions to do something<br/>
**Solution:** A common problem is that postgres cannot start due to a permissions issue somewhere, possibly in `/var/run/postgresql` or elsewhere. If this occurs, please [File an issue](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/issues?state=open).
***
**Problem:** The provided database file is not able to be automatically built<br/>
**Solution:** Upgrade the database to the current release version first before attempting install.
***
**Problem:** A config file looks wrong.<br/>
**Solution:** [File a bug report](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/issues?state=open). Changing it by hand will probably break some automatically-installed thing you didn't know existed.
***
**Problem:** A cluster already exists.<br/>
**Solution:**  Either run the `uninstall-<type>` command first to uninstall the existing instance, or change the `--xt-name` argument. `--xt-name` and `--xt-version` together identify each installation.

### e. Updating the xTuple Server using npm

#### What is npm?

The xTuple Server is an **`npm`** module, and is hosted here: https://www.npmjs.org/package/xtuple-server. `npm` is a package management system for node.js modules, similar to `apt-get`, `yum`, or `maven`. It can be mixed and matched with other modules on npmjs.org, and all of its dependencies are automatically downloaded and installed. This makes upgrading to newer versions very easy.

### How to upgrade

All new versions of the xTuple Server will be uploaded to npmjs.org. If a new version contains a new feature or bugfix that you want, you can easily upgrade the xTuple Server software with one command.

```bash
$ npm install -fg xtuple-server
$ sudo xtuple-server setup
```

Using the dependency-management magic of npm, all of the updated dependencies will be pulled along with it. Once this command finishes, you can start using the new version of the server. That's it!
