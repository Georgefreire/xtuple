These instructions will guide you through the setup of the [xTuple Server](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki), a software toolkit for managing the server components of the xTuple ERP application. Once you complete the installation of the xTuple Server toolkit you will be able to install and manage instances of xTuple ERP. 

We also have created a video series that will help walk through the steps of setting up and managing your xTuple Server.

# Before You Begin

Choose one of these options for pre-installation setup:
* DEMO -- If you are installing the xTuple Server for demonstration/exploration purposes, we recommend you [set up a Vagrant VM to host the xTuple Server](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki/Set-up-a-Vagrant-VM-for-the-xTuple-Server) and then return to this page to follow the bootstrap steps below.

* PRODUCTION -- If you are installing the server for production, please follow the [Steps to Install Ubuntu](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki/Steps-to-Install-Ubuntu) on a dedicated machine and then return to follow the bootstrap steps below.

* DEVELOPMENT -- If you are installing xTuple in order to modify or contribute code, follow the instructions to [Set up an xTuple Vagrant Developer Environment](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-vagrant/blob/master/README.md) before following the instructions below.

If you have any questions, **[please ask here](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/issues?state=open)**. 

Please keep the following items in mind:
- Before you run bootstrap, you need to make sure the machine you are installing on is able to access this list of sites (you might try a 'ping' from the command line):
     - archive.ubuntu.org
     - registry.npmjs.org
     - sourceforge.net
     - github.com
- Postgres is installed for you. So are nginx and node.js. And everything else.
    - Do not install these yourself! If you think something is missing, please [file an issue](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/issues?state=open).
- The Installer generates credentials. And users. And everything else.
    - Before running the installer, find a pen and paper. When the installer finishes, it displays credentials.

# Bootstrap Commands

Once you have set up a Vagrant virtual machine or a dedicated Ubuntu server, log into that machine and enter the following commands. Each will take a few minutes to execute. See below for a full explanation of what each command does.

#### 1. `wget xtuple.com/bootstrap -qO- | sudo bash`
#### 2. `npm install -g xtuple-server`
#### 3. `sudo xtuple-server setup`
- Set the following options where needed ([reference](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki/3.-Reference#setup)):
  - `--sys-webmindomain`
  - `--sys-webmincrt`
  - `--sys-webminkey`
- Login credentials will be displayed.
- If you are using Vagrant, webmin should be accessible here: https://192.168.33.10/webmin


## Bootstrap and Installation Details
#### 1. `bootstrap`
  - What does it do?
    - Installs system dependencies including PostgreSQL, node, and nginx
    - Installs the `xtuple-server` CLI into the global path
    - **Note:** Running bootstrap is destructive. This means that it bends your machine to its will, possibly deleting and moving things in the process. Do not run this on any machine that contains data you care about. [Do this instead](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki/4.-Local-Development#a-using-vagrant).
  - How do I make it do those things?
    - `wget xtuple.com/bootstrap -qO- | sudo bash`
      - Automatically downloads the bootstrap program and executes it as root. It will recommend that you restart when it finishes, which is good advice.

#### 2. `xtuple-server`
  - What does it do?
    - Sets up users, permissions, packages, services
    - Configures quite a lot of murky OS-level unpleasantness
    - Installs new xTuple instances, restores databases, backs up clusters, etc.
    - Manages xTuple services
  - How do I get that?
    - `npm install -g xtuple-server`
  - The xTuple Server also includes a `setup` command that is run before any installations. It prepares the machine and installs some additional system services for management and monitoring, and installs more stringent security policies.
    - `sudo xtuple-server setup`
  - How do I make it install something?
    - `sudo xtuple-server install-pilot --xt-name alpha --xt-version 4.7.0 --xt-demo`
    - This installs a single xTuple version 4.7.0 database called `alpha_pilot` for user `alpha`. A unix account for a new `alpha` user is created, and that account is given ownership of the new postgres cluster that is created. Secure credentials and other access info are generated for you, they will be shown in a report once installation is finished.
