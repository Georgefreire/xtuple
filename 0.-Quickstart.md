These instructions will guide you through the setup of the [xTuple Server](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki), a software toolkit for managing the server components of the xTuple ERP application. Once you complete the installation of the xTuple Server toolkit you will be able to install and manage instances of xTuple ERP. 

# Before You Begin

Choose one of these options for pre-installation setup:
* DEMO -- If you are installing the xTuple Server for demonstration/exploration purposes, we recommend you [set up a Vagrant VM to host the xTuple Server](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki/Set-up-a-Vagrant-VM-for-the-xTuple-Server) and then return to this page to follow the bootstrap steps below.

* PRODUCTION -- If you are installing the server for production, please follow the [Steps to Install Ubuntu](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki/Steps-to-Install-Ubuntu) on a dedicated machine and then return to follow the bootstrap steps below.

* DEVELOPMENT -- If you are installing xTuple in order to modify or contribute code, follow the instructions to [Set up an xTuple Vagrant Developer Environment](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-vagrant/blob/master/README.md) before following the instructions below.

If you have any questions, **[please ask here](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/issues?state=open)**. 

Please keep the following items in mind:
- Before you run bootstrap, you need to make sure the machine you are installing on is able to access this list of sites (you might try a 'ping' from the command line):
     - archive.ubuntu.org
     - registry.npmjs.org
     - sourceforge.net
     - github.com
- Postgres is installed for you. So are nginx and node.js. And everything else.
    - Do not install these yourself! If you think something is missing, please [file an issue](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/issues?state=open).
- The Installer generates credentials. And users. And everything else.
    - Before running the installer, find a pen and paper. When the installer finishes, it displays credentials.

# Bootstrap Commands

Once you have set up a Vagrant virtual machine or a dedicated Ubuntu server, log into that machine and enter the following commands. Each will take a few minutes to execute. See below for a full explanation of what each command does.

#### 1. `wget xtuple.com/bootstrap -qO- | sudo bash`
#### 2. `npm install -g xtuple-server` (do not use sudo)
#### 3. `sudo xtuple-server setup`
- Set the following options where needed ([reference](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki/3.-Reference#setup)):
  - `--sys-webmindomain`
  - `--sys-webmincrt`
  - `--sys-webminkey`
- Login credentials will be displayed.
- If you are using Vagrant, webmin should be accessible here: https://192.168.33.10/webmin


## Bootstrap and Installation Details
#### 1. `bootstrap.sh`

The bootstrap program installs the basic system tools, including PostgreSQL, node, and nginx, required to build and run an xTuple Server.

**Note:** Running bootstrap is destructive - it bends your machine to its will, possibly deleting and moving things in the process. Do not run this on any machine that contains data you care about. [Do this instead](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki/4.-Local-Development#a-using-vagrant).

How do I make it do those things?

    $ wget xtuple.com/bootstrap -qO- | sudo bash

This automatically downloads the bootstrap program and executes it as the administrative user `root`. It will recommend that you restart when it finishes, which is good advice.

#### 2. `xtuple-server`

The xtuple-server program picks up where bootstrap leaves off. You use it for all of the following and more:

- Sets up users, permissions, packages, services
- Configures quite a lot of murky OS-level unpleasantness
- Installs new xTuple instances, restores databases, backs up clusters, etc.
- Manages xTuple services

How do I get that?

    $ npm install -g xtuple-server

Why doesn't `bootstrap.sh` install `xtuple-server`? In future versions it might. For now, please bear with us and `npm install` it.

#### 3. `setup`

The xTuple Server includes a `setup` command that should be run before any installations. It finishes preparing the machine and operating system, installs some additional system services for management and monitoring, and installs more stringent security policies.

How do I make it do those things?

    sudo xtuple-server setup

#### Now what?

How do I make `xtuple-server` install something?

    sudo xtuple-server install-pilot --xt-name alpha --xt-version 4.7.0 --xt-demo

This installs a single xTuple version 4.7.0 database called `alpha_pilot` for user `alpha`. This creates a new account for the Linux/UNIX user `alpha`, creates a new Postgres cluster owned by `alpha`, and generates secure credentials and other access info for you. These credentials will be displayed once installation is finished.

### Updating the xTuple Server using npm

#### What is npm?
  - The xTuple Server is an **`npm`** module, and is hosted here: https://www.npmjs.org/package/xtuple-server. 
  - `npm` is a package management system for node.js modules, similar to `apt-get`, `yum`, or `maven`.     
  - It can be mixed and matched with other modules on npmjs.org, and all of its dependencies are automatically downloaded and installed. This makes upgrading to newer versions very easy.

#### How to upgrade xtuple-server

All new versions of the xTuple Server will be uploaded to npmjs.org. If a new version contains a new feature or bugfix that you want, you can easily upgrade the xTuple Server software with one command.

```bash
$ npm install -fg xtuple-server
$ sudo xtuple-server setup
```

Using the dependency-management magic of npm, all of the updated dependencies will be pulled along with it. Once this command finishes, you can start using the new version of the server. That's it!

#### How to check what version of xtuple-server you have installed

The `npm ls` command will tell you the current version of any npm module. The full command for xtuple-server is:

```bash
$ npm ls -g xtuple-server
```
