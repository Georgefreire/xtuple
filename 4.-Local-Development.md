### 1. Local Development Environment
Have a bugfix or feature you'd like to contribute to this project? You can develop on the xTuple Server like you might develop most other node.js apps.
  
#### A. Set Up Vagrant
Setting up xTuple on Vagrant is really easy! Just follow **[this guide](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki/Set-up-a-Vagrant-VM-for-the-xTuple-Server)**. We strongly recommend that you do not develop directly on your personal machine. Keep in mind that this tool requires `sudo` even for testing, and that writing bad code could completely dork your system. `sudo` is forever. If you have a dedicated box that you don't care much about for doing xtuple-server development, using the `--nginx-safeport` option is recommended for local development; nginx will bind to a non-privileged port.

#### B. Install the project
(these instructions are still a work in progress)
```
$ wget xtuple.com/bootstrap -qO- | sudo bash
$ git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username}/xtuple-server-core.git
$ git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username}/xtuple-server.git
$ cd xtuple-server-core
$ npm install
$ cd ../xtuple-server
$ npm install
$ npm link ../xtuple-server-core/lib
$ npm link ../xtuple-server-core
$ rm index.js
$ cp ../xtuple-server-core/index.js .
$ cp ../xtuple-server-core/cli.js .
$ npm install commander
$ cd ../xtuple-server-core
$ npm link ../xtuple-server/tasks/pg/tuner
$ npm link ../xtuple-server/tasks/pg/snapshotmgr
$ npm link ../xtuple-server/tasks/sys/cups
$ npm link ../xtuple-server/tasks/sys/paths
$ npm link ../xtuple-server/tasks/sys/policy
$ npm link ../xtuple-server/tasks/sys/service
$ npm link ../xtuple-server/tasks/sys/ssh
$ npm link ../xtuple-server/tasks/sys/webmin
$ npm link ../xtuple-server/tasks/sys/xvfb
$ cd ../xtuple-server
$ sudo node ./cli.js setup # this may fail but run it anyway
$ sudo node ./cli.js install-pilot --xt-version 4.8.0 --xt-name aurora --pg-capacity 64 --xt-quickstart
```

Some additional steps are required to allow running the `xtuple-server-core` test suite:
```bash
$ cd ../xtuple-server-core
$ git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username}/xtuple.git
$ cd xtuple
$ git checkout {your-commit-ish}
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ cd ..
```

### 2. Contributions
After setting up your environment in step 1, you can start coding and testing!
  - To run your changes, you can invoke the `xtuple-server` CLI script:
    ```bash
      $ sudo ./cli <plan> [options] ...
    ```  

  - Test your changes:
    ```bash
      $ sudo npm test
    ```

  It's our job at xTuple to maintain this server and keep it bug-free. Hopefully
  you won't have to spend any time hacking in here. If you run into problems,
  please file an issue in github.
