### 1. Local Development Environment
Have a bugfix or feature you'd like to contribute to this project? You can develop on the xTuple Server like you might develop most other node.js apps.
  
#### A. Set Up Vagrant
Setting up xTuple on Vagrant is really easy! Just follow **[this guide](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki/Set-up-a-Vagrant-VM-for-the-xTuple-Server)**. We strongly recommend that you do not develop directly on your personal machine. Keep in mind that this tool requires `sudo` even for testing, and that writing bad code could completely dork your system. `sudo` is forever. If you have a dedicated box that you don't care much about for doing xtuple-server development, using the `--nginx-safeport` option is recommended for local development; nginx will bind to a non-privileged port.

#### B. Install the project
```
$ wget xtuple.com/bootstrap -qO- | sudo bash
$ git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username}/xtuple-server-core.git
$ git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username}/xtuple-server.git
$ cd xtuple-server-core
$ npm install
$ cd ../xtuple-server
$ npm install
$ export NODE_PATH=/home/vagrant/xtuple-server/node_modules
$ sudo -E bash -c 'echo $NODE_PATH'
$ cd ../xtuple-server-core
$ sudo -E node ./cli.js setup
$ sudo -E node ./cli.js install-pilot --xt-version 4.8.0 --xt-name aurora --pg-capacity 64 --xt-quickstart
```

There are other ways to do it but this is known to work. For example, an alternative to setting the NODE_PATH and using -E is to make sure that all of the xtuple-server modules in node_modules are symlinked to the code in your dev environment and not modules from the npm registry. Like:

```
$ cd xtuple-server-core
$ npm link ../xtuple-server/tasks/pg/tuner
+ lots more npm linking
```


Some additional steps are required to allow running the `xtuple-server-core` test suite:
```bash
$ cd ../xtuple-server-core
$ git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username}/xtuple.git
$ cd xtuple
$ git checkout {your-commit-ish}
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ cd ..
```

### 2. Contributions
After setting up your environment in step 1, you can start coding and testing!
  - To run your changes, you can invoke the `xtuple-server` CLI script:
    ```bash
      $ sudo ./cli <plan> [options] ...
    ```  

  - Test your changes:
    ```bash
      $ sudo npm test
    ```

  It's our job at xTuple to maintain this server and keep it bug-free. Hopefully
  you won't have to spend any time hacking in here. If you run into problems,
  please file an issue in github.
