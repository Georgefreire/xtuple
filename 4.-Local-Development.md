### 1. Local Development Environment
Have a bugfix or feature you'd like to contribute to this project? You can develop on the xTuple Server like you might develop most other node.js apps.
  
#### A. Using Vagrant
Setting up xTuple on Vagrant is really easy! Just follow **[this guide](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki/Set-up-a-Vagrant-VM-for-the-xTuple-Server)**. We strongly recommend that you do not develop directly on your personal machine. `sudo` is forever.

#### B. Bare Metal
- Keep in mind that this tool requires `sudo` even for testing, and that writing bad code could completely dork your system. We strongly recommend that you use Vagrant.
- Using the `--nginx-safeport` option is recommended for local development; nginx will bind to a non-privileged port

### 2. Contributions
After setting up your environment in step 1, you can start coding and testing!
  - To run your changes, you can invoke the `xtuple-server` CLI script:
    ```bash
      $ sudo ./cli <plan> [options] ...
    ```  

  - Test your changes:
    ```bash
      $ sudo npm test
    ```

  It's our job at xTuple to maintain this server and keep it bug-free. Hopefully
  you won't have to spend any time hacking in here. If you run into problems,
  please file an issue in github.
